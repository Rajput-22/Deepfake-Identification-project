Deepfake Identification Project
## 📌 Overview
The "Deepfake Identification Project" is a deep learning–based system designed to detect manipulated or AI-generated facial media. The project leverages convolutional neural networks and modern computer vision techniques to distinguish between real and deepfake content, addressing growing concerns around digital misinformation and identity fraud.
